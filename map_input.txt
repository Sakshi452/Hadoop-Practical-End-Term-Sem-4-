What I won’t tell you is how I became a flute
and brushed against lips but there was no music.
When the blows came furious as juniper.

There were days when I was a parachute
and the wind was free but kind. I won’t lie
and say there were no such days. There were days
India India India India India


India India India India India

to stay anchored. Tsunami greeted me in its maw.
I have his smell all about me but it dwindles every day.

India India India India India

India India India India India
India India India India India
India India India India India

What was there to lose that I hadn’t already lost?
Alone, in the middle of the night, the road smelled
like freshly sawed mesquite. I wormed my way out.
India India India India India
India India India India India
India India India India India
India India India India India
India India India India India

A buckle still loomed in the background.
And I told myself, there is no gleam.
